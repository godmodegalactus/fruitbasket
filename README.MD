# Fruit basket
## USE
This is a solana smart contract to create, buy, sell and trade a basket of crypto currencies. Fruitbasket enables the user to buy or sell a basket of crypto currencies virtualized into a fungible token, which is minted to the user upon buying and burned upon selling the basket. Baskets are important financial instruments because they provide investors a way to diversify and hedge their assets with ease. When a user buys a basket from Fruitbasket, the underlying tokens are pooled, these pools can be used for staking, for validators or for borrowing and lending markets. Users will be also rewarded by creating, buying and holding these baskets.

* Diversify your investments : 
It is simpler to diversify investments by creating and buying baskets of multiple tokens which target different sectors and technologies. In the cryptocurrency markets, there are some tokens which may do x100 in a short time, but it is difficult to identify these tokens in advance. But market experts can create some baskets which could contain potentially promising/rising crypto assets. This will allow the user to diversify their investments in a better way. The tedious task of manually creating a basket of tokens is largely avoided and the user can focus more on investment strategy and risk management. In the rewards program, the creator of the basket can also get rewards based on how much investment was done on the created basket.

* Hedge your investments : 
Hedging in traditional financial markets is done by various instruments and by implementing various strategies. Investors can hedge against their positions by buying a Put option to limit their losses. Investors can create baskets of these tokens so that they are easier to manage. Fruitbasket is modular in nature i.e either all the tokens are bought or none of them is. The investor does not need to worry about partial fills, which is one of the key advantages of Fruitbasket.
